# FinancialSentimentAnalysis_TimTwoOne
An AI model to predict the stock markets direction based on the news sentiment. Uses FinBERT as the base model. THis repository may not contain the most update work from our team. We recommend you to check the Google Colab links here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qrpKfRdDMBJUQZWV-58QymGbrUbS7vof?usp=sharing. 

Note: The FinBERT model currently only accepts prediction using English. Any other languages that the model needs to predict must first be translated to English. We haven't provide an implementation of translating the dataset directly yet for this project.
